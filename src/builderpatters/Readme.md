####Bulder pattern
used to create objects made from a bunch of other objects.

 Cases when used
-  when you want to build an object made up of other objects.
-  when you want the creation of those parts be independent of the main object.
-  Hide the creation of the parts from client so that both aren't dependent.
-  The builder knows the specifics and nobody else.


####Example
- Example1
  A simple robot creation project.
  
- Example2
