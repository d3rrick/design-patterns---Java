####Bulder pattern
- under creational patterns.
- used to create objects made from a bunch of other objects.
- builds complex objects bit by bit.
- builds composite objects - one object has multiple compositions of other objects,

 Cases when used
-  when you want to build an object made up of other objects.
-  when you want the creation of those parts be independent of the main object.
-  Hide the creation of the parts from client so that both aren't dependent.
-  The builder knows the specifics and nobody else.
- to avoid alot a values in the constructor
